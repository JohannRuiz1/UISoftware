#### Ideation
- Creating various and innovative proposals for ecological, interaction, and emotional designs
- Ideation informers
	- provide information about usage, requirements, targets, and goals, and are part of immersion
	- Inform by pointing to design-oriented aspects, like task descriptions or user personas
	- Types
		- User work roles: identify the types of users and work that the design should support
		- Personas: Supporting a particular archetype of work role in the work domain
- Ideation catalysts
	- design inspirers, design-oriented flashes that inspire creative design solutions 
- Ideation techniques
	- something a designer can do to foster the spawning of a design idea
	- Brainstorming, framing, and storytelling 

Ideation Tecniques
- Framing and reframing: represent a design technique that poses the design problem along a particular dimension to spark a otherwise unconsidered analysis of tradeoffs
- Abstraction
- Asking "What if?"
- Incubation: taking a break
- Design Pattern: Repeatable solution to a common design problem
- Embodied and Tangible interaction: Having body, interaction between human user and physical object


### Prototyping
- Horizontal prototyping: Breadth (Your prototype has every page in the website, but little to no content)
- Vertical prototyping: Depth (The entire first page is prototyped)
- Fidelity: Level of detail (Adding color, font, images, style, animation, etc)

#### Wireframe Prototypes
- Bulk made during interaction design creation
- Sketch, image, or prototype of a single interaction page or screen
- Low fidelity wireframes contain
	- Header.
	- Footer.
	- Content areas.
	- Labeling.
	- Menus.
	- Tabs (possibly with drop-downs)
	- Buttons.
	- Icons.
	- Pop-ups.
	- Messages.
	- Navigation bar, navigation links.
	- Placeholders for logo and branding images.
	- Search field.
- Wireflow: Sequence of wireframes, state diagram of user workflow
- Create state diagram of user interaction, each box represents a wireframe
- Sequence of Wireframe Prototyping
	1) Quick and dirty hand sketches 
	2) Create deck of wireframes of sketches
	3) No interaction or navigation, summarize and solidify design
	4) Increase fidelity, add more screens or details to each screen (color, images, template, styles)
	5) Add decoy buttons even if not implemented (Display "feature not yet implemented)
	6) Hand off to software developer
