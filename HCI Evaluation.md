## Expert Evaluation
#### Cognitive walkthrough
- Start with user, task, interface
- Determine steps needed to complete task
- For each step, ask key questions
	- Will the correct action be made sufficiently evident to the user?
	- Will the user connect the correct action's description with what he or she is trying to do?
	- Will the user interpret the system's response to the chosen action correctly

#### Heuristic evaluation 
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and Documentation

- Heuristic Evaluation Report
	- Overview of system being evaluated
	- Potential usability problems revealed by inspection
	- Include as many screen images or visual examples as possible 
	- Conclude with realistic list of Top 3/4/5 prioritized suggestions to give the biggest improvement in usability 

## Real User Evaluation

- Experiments
	- Correlation vs. causation: Changing a variable
	- Quasi-experiment: Look into demographics/groups (age, gender), no definitive answer
- Lab (highly controlled study) vs. field (authentic, natural, real-world) studies
	- Control vs. Authenticity
	- Access (will you have access to the group of target users)
- Validity
	- Internal, external, ecological 


#### Data collection methods
- Think-aloud
- Questionnaires
- Interviews
- Participant-observation
- System logs
- Ethnographic studies
- What questions are you trying to answer?


## 10 Usability Heuristics for UI Design
1) Visibility of System Status: Keep user informed on what is going on, with feedback in a reasonable amount of time
2) Match Between the System and the Real World: Use familiar words, phrases, and concepts to the user, use real-world convention
3) User Control and Freedom: Easily exit unwanted actions
4) Consistency and Standards: Follow platform and industry convention (For example, don't strive away from a shopping cart to be unique, it's a standard now, people also look to the top right for sign in, it's common)
5) Error Prevention: Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with confirmation options before committing to the action
6) Recognition Rather than Recall: Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible; the user shouldn't have to remember information from one part of the interface to another
7) Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Use shortcuts, which are hidden for new users, but very beneficial for expert users (customization as well)
8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: All interface information should be relevant 
9) Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: Error messages expressed in plain language, indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution
10) Help and Documentation: It shouldn't be necessary to use, but helpful to provide 

## How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation 
- Systematically review your product to find potential UX problems
- Choosing a set of heuristics 
- Good to do before user participants 
- Develop strong UX instincts, find common usability issues
- Step 1: Prepare for the Heuristic Evaluation
	- Choose and Train Your Team
	- Decide How to Document Evaluations (Spreadsheet, digital whiteboard)
	- Set the scope (One task at a time, one section, one user group, one device type, etc)
- Step 2: Evaluate Independently
	- Become familiar with the Product
	- Look for issues
- Step 3: Consolidate Identified Issues with Team
	- Where do we agree/disagree, most determineal, most problematic, issues we need more data on, short term and long term goals
