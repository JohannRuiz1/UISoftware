## Expert Evaluation
#### Cognitive walkthrough
- Start with user, task, interface
- Determine steps needed to complete task
- For each step, ask key questions
	- Will the correct action be made sufficiently evident to the user?
	- Will the user connect the correct action's description with what he or she is trying to do?
	- Will the user interpret the system's response to the chosen action correctly

#### Heuristic evaluation 
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize diagnose, and recover from errors
- Heuristic Evaluation Report
	- Overview of system being evaluated
	- Potential usability problems revealed by inspection
	- Include as many screen images or visual examples as possible 
	- Conclude with realistic list of Top 3/4/5 prioritized suggestions to give the biggest improvement in usability 

## Real User Evaluation

- Experiments
	- Correlation vs. causation: Changing a variable
	- Quasi-experiment: Look into demographics/groups (age, gender), no definitive answer
- Lab (highly controlled study) vs. field (authentic, natural, real-world) studies
	- Control vs. Authenticity
	- Access (will you have access to the group of target users)
- Validity
	- Internal, external, ecological 


#### Data collection methods
- Think-aloud
- Questionnaires
- Interviews
- Participant-observation
- System logs
- Ethnographic studies
- What questions are you trying to answer?
